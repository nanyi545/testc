If you want to use a nonstandard name for your makefile, you can specify the makefile name with the ' -f ' or ' --file ' option.
 The arguments ' -f name ' or ' --file= name ' tell make to read the file name as the makefile.

  make -f Mk1

Makefile Syntax

A Makefile consists of a set of rules. A rule generally looks like this:

targets: prerequisites
	command
	command
	command

The targets are file names, separated by spaces. Typically, there is only one per rule.
The commands are a series of steps typically used to make the target(s). These need to start with a tab character, not spaces.
The prerequisites are also file names, separated by spaces. These files need to exist before the commands for the target are run. These are also called dependencies

Beginner Examples

mk1: mk1.o
	cc mk1.o -o mk1 # step2

mk1.o: mk1.c
	cc -c mk1.c -o mk1.o # step1

CC is an environment variable referring to the system's C compiler. What it points to (libraries accessible, etc) depend on platform.
Often it will point to /usr/bin/cc, the actual c complier (driver). On linux platforms, CC almost always points to /usr/bin/gcc.

gcc is the driver binary for the GNU compiler collection. It can compile C, C++, and possibly other languages; it determines the language by the file extension.

g++ is a driver binary like gcc, but with a few special options set for compiling C++. Notably (in my experience), g++ will link libstdc++ by default, while gcc won't.
