If you want to use a nonstandard name for your makefile, you can specify the makefile name with the ' -f ' or ' --file ' option.
 The arguments ' -f name ' or ' --file= name ' tell make to read the file name as the makefile.

  make -f Mk1

Makefile Syntax

A Makefile consists of a set of rules. A rule generally looks like this:

targets: prerequisites
	command
	command
	command

The targets are file names, separated by spaces. Typically, there is only one per rule.
The commands are a series of steps typically used to make the target(s). These need to start with a tab character, not spaces.
The prerequisites are also file names, separated by spaces. These files need to exist before the commands for the target are run. These are also called dependencies

Beginner Examples

mk1: mk1.o
	cc mk1.o -o mk1 # step2

mk1.o: mk1.c
	cc -c mk1.c -o mk1.o # step1

------------------------------------------------------------------------

CC is an environment variable referring to the system's C compiler. What it points to (libraries accessible, etc) depend on platform.
Often it will point to /usr/bin/cc, the actual c complier (driver). On linux platforms, CC almost always points to /usr/bin/gcc.

gcc is the driver binary for the GNU compiler collection. It can compile C, C++, and possibly other languages; it determines the language by the file extension.

g++ is a driver binary like gcc, but with a few special options set for compiling C++. Notably (in my experience), g++ will link libstdc++ by default, while gcc won't.

touch command: It is used to create a file without any content.
The file created using touch command is empty. This command can be used when the user doesnâ€™t have data to store at the time of file creation.

gcc -o hellomake hellomake.c hellofunc.c -I.

This compiles the two .c files and names the executable hellomake.
The -I. is included so that gcc will look in the current directory (.) for the include file hellomake.h.

---
The simplest makefile you could create would look something like:

# Makefile 1
hellomake: hellomake.c hellofunc.c
     gcc -o hellomake hellomake.c hellofunc.c -I.



---
In order to be a bit more efficient, let's try the following:

# Makefile 2
CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-I.

hellomake: hellomake.o hellofunc.o
     $(CC) -o hellomake hellomake.o hellofunc.o $(CFLAGS)

---
If you were to make a change to hellomake.h, for example, make would not recompile the .c files,
even though they needed to be. In order to fix this, we need to tell make that all .c files depend on certain .h files.


# Makefile 3
CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-I.
DEPS = hellomake.h

%.o: %.c $(DEPS)
	$(CC) -c -o $@ $< $(CFLAGS)

hellomake: hellomake.o hellofunc.o
	$(CC) -o hellomake hellomake.o hellofunc.o

all: library.cpp main.cpp
In this case:
$@ evaluates to all
$< evaluates to library.cpp
$^ evaluates to library.cpp main.cpp

%.o: %.c
        $(CC) -c $^ -o $@
is a pattern rule, which is a type of implicit rule. It specifies one target and one dependency,
and causes one invocation of $(CC) for each target.

https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Pattern-Rules.html#Pattern-Rules
------


As a final simplification, let's use the special macros $@ and $^, which are the left and right sides of the :, respectively,
 to make the overall compilation rule more general.


# Makefile 4
CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-I.
DEPS = hellomake.h
OBJ = hellomake.o hellofunc.o

%.o: %.c $(DEPS)
	$(CC) -c -o $@ $< $(CFLAGS)

hellomake: $(OBJ)
	$(CC) -o $@ $^ $(CFLAGS)

So what if we want to start putting our .h files in an include directory, our source code in a src directory, and some local libraries in a lib directory?
Also, can we somehow hide those annoying .o files that hang around all over the place?



The following makefile defines paths to the include and lib directories, and places the object files in an obj subdirectory within the src directory.
 It also has a macro defined for any libraries you want to include, such as the math library -lm.
 This makefile should be located in the src directory. Note that it also includes a rule for cleaning up your source and object directories if you type
 make clean.
 The .PHONY rule keeps make from doing something with a file named clean.


---> make file 5 not quite sure ???
